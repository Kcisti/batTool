# batTool Presentation
I'm excited to introduce my new Tool, completely written in Python! After a lot of hard work and passion, I've created a tool that I believe can be really useful for anyone needing to gather information and track data online. Here's what it can do:

  1. *Track IP Addresses*: Want to know more about an IP address? This Tool provides details like geographic location, ISP, and more.

  2. *Lookup Phone Numbers*: Need information on a phone number? The Tool can help you identify the owner and their location.

  3. *Download Data from Instagram*: Want to analyze Instagram profiles? You can easily download posts, photos, videos, and stories.

  4. *Download Videos from YouTube*: Don’t have an internet connection but want to watch your favorite videos? Download them in various formats and resolutions to have them with you always.

  5. *Search Online Traces*: Discover traces left by users on various sites and platforms for an in-depth analysis of their online activities.

I've worked hard to make the Tool easy to use. Whether you're a data analyst, researcher, or just curious, I think you'll find this tool really helpful.
I hope you enjoy it and find it as useful as I did creating it. Try out all its features and let me know what you think!

If you have any questions or need help, don’t hesitate to contact me.
